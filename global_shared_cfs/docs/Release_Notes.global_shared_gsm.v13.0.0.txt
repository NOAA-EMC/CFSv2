v13.0.0 - released February 1, 2016

Based on gsm.v12.3.0, included the following changes

1. Added modulefiles/gfs/gsm_v13.0.0 to use modulefiles for compiling code.        
   Added build_gsm_wcoss.sh to set up modules to call the following makefiles
   sorc/global_chgres.fd/makefile_wcoss.sh
   sorc/global_cycle.fd/makefile_wcoss.sh
   sorc/global_fcst.fd/makefile_wcoss.sh
   sorc/global_sfchdr.fd/makefile_wcoss.sh
   sorc/global_sighdr.fd/makefile_wcoss.sh

   Type build_gsm_wcoss.sh to buid above five executables.
  
   Attention: after the fast byte-swap BACIO library is implemented, please 
              use makefile_wcoss.sh_new to replace makefile_wcoss.sh 
 
2. Updated the following files
   sorc/global_chgres.fd/Makefile
   sorc/global_chgres.fd/makefile.sh
   sorc/global_cycle.fd/Makefile
   sorc/global_cycle.fd/makefile.sh
   sorc/global_fcst.fd/Makefile
   sorc/global_sfchdr.fd/Makefile
   sorc/global_sfchdr.fd/makefile.sh
   sorc/global_sighdr.fd/Makefile
   sorc/global_sighdr.fd/makefile.sh

3. modified sorc/global_fcst.fd/GFS_GridComp_ESMFMod.f and GEFS_CplComp_ESMFMod.f
   to resolve compiler errors when using the intel/15.0.3.187 compiler on Cray. 
   Provided by Christopher Redder.

4. modified w3movdat in sorc/global_sfchdr.fd/sfchdr.f and sorc/global_sighdr.fd/sighdr.f to 
   conform to fortran 2008 ANSI standard that each ac-value expression in an array-constructor 
   must have the same type and type parameters. Provided by Christopher Redder.

5. The following scripts have been updated  to follow NCO implementation standard.
     jobs/JGDAS_FORECAST_HIGH
     jobs/JGFS_FORECAST_HIGH
     jobs/JGFS_FORECAST_LOW
     scripts/exglobal_fcst.sh.ecf
     ush/global_chgres.sh
     ush/global_cycle.sh
   Standard alone experiments in simulated operational environment have been conducted 
   to test these scripts.
