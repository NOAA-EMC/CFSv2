Origin and contents of cfs frozen model global_shared_cfs
---------------------------------------------------------

This set of scripts and codes is based on /nwprod2/global_shared.v13.0.7 vertical structure model with the following changes:

1) /nwprod/fix/crtm_2.0.5 is included in the model root.

2) the tropcy scripts and codes from the /nwprod horizontal structure are substituted for the ones native to this model.

   These include:

   scripts/extropcy_qc_reloc.sh.ecf
   ush/tropcy_relocate.sh
   ush/tropcy_relocate_extrkr.sh
   sorc/relocate_mv_nvortex.fd
   sorc/supvit.fd
   sorc/gettrk.fd

These changes were made to create identical results with cfs.v2.1.28. 

This model is included in the portable standardized cfs vertical strucutre which will port to the dell wcoss 3 platform.
It will also provide frozen versions of the global_chgres.fd, global_cycle.fd, global_sfchdr.fd, global_sighdr.fd needed by the cfs model.
Additionally included is a newer version of gsi.fd for possible expansion of the observing systems which can be assimilated in the cdas analysis.
