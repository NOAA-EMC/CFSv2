The files here (*.F90) replace the corresponding files in your directory
/global/save/wx23sm/para_exp/cfs_para/sorc/godas.fd/MOM4/src/mom4/ocean_anl_dev

The files 

godas.F90
godas_data.F90
godas_solo.F90
godas_types.F90
ocean_model.F90

have new code added.

The file

godas_rstr.F90

is entirely new. It adds the capability of restoring the SST and SSS to fields
of gridded data by relaxation.  There are associated data_table and namelist
entries (see below).

The executable 

fms_gdsSOLO.x

is new.

The file data_table.GDS has the entries added to the MOM4 data_table that 
this version of GODAS needs.  The lines labeled "OBS" should already be there.
The lines labeled "ORS" are new and are for the SST and SSS restoration. The
files identified there contain the SST and SSS analyses used for the
restorations.  Look in the subdirectory PREP for the codes that prepare
these files.

The field_table file should be used for both MOM4 and for GODAS

The namelist.M should be used for MOM4

The namelist.G should be used for GODAS.  Three lines have been added to the
godas_nml section:
      num_rstr_tracers=2
      sst_damp=0.1
      sss_damp=0.1
which are for the restoration code (and are the default values). The damping
parameters can vary from 0.0 (no restoration) to 1.0 (GODAS 5 meter T or S
replaced by input SST or SSS analysis). The code will reset them if they are 
out of this range.
