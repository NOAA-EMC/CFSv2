The files here (*.F90) replace the corresponding files in your directory
/global/save/wx23sm/para_exp/cfs_para/sorc/godas.fd/MOM4/src/mom4/ocean_anl_dev

The executable
fms_gdsSOLO.x
is based on these corrected codes.
(My recollection is that this is the executable that you use.)
If you recompile make sure you use the corrected codes.

Because of the finer resolution, you will need to reset some parameters
in the namelist.   Down in the godas_nml section reset
  npits=260
  acoef=0.0025

I think that's it.  Let me know what happens.
