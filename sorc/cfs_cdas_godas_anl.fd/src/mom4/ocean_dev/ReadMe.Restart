Initial Conditions:
Once begun all the restarts listed below will be created and used for subsequent initial
conditions.

For a cold start, it looks like ocean_temp_salt.res.nc could be used and no others would
be necessary. For a cold start Time%init=.true. which can be accomplished by having the
run start time equal to the experiment initial time. To do this set the date_init in the
ocean_solo_nml namelist and do NOT provide a ocean_solo.res file. Both the experiment
initial time and the run start time will be set by date_init.  -OR-  Provide an
ocean_solo.res file with the two dates set the same, the first will be the experiment
initial time and the second will be the run start time. The ocean_solo.res file
overrides the namelist.

ASCII restarts:
ocean_solo.res                    - not necessary, but simple to set up
ocean_tracer.res                  - not necessary, written at end, does not affect start

netCDF restarts:
ocean_temp_salt.res.nc            - necessary
ocean_velocity.res.nc             - not necessary, if absent, velocities set to 0.0
ocean_velocity_advection.res.nc   - not necessary, only read if ocean_velocity.res.nc present
                                     and Time%init=.false.
ocean_sbc.res.nc                  - not necessary, contains T,S,U,V,ETA,Frazil surface values
ocean_freesurf.res.nc             - necessary, set to 0.0 may be OK 
                                    (see Time%init=.true. & namelist: zero_eta_ic=.true.)
ocean_neutral.res.nc              - necessary if agm_closure=.true. & Time%init=.false.
ocean_frazil.res.nc               - necessary ?, seems OK filled with 0.0
ocean_density.res.nc              - not necessary, if absent, computed from T, S
