          <p>The Modular Ocean Model (MOM) is a numerical
          representation of the ocean's hydrostatic primitive
          equations, and it is designed primarily as a tool for
          studying the global ocean climate system. MOM4 is the
          latest version of the GFDL ocean model whose origins date
          back to the pioneering work of Kirk Bryan and Mike Cox in
          the 1960s-1980s. It is developed and supported by
          researchers at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
          Laboratory (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov" target=
          "_top">GFDL</a>), with contributions also provided by
          researchers worldwide.</p>
          <p>The first release of MOM4 took place January of 2004.
          There have been four releases of this code: MOM4p0a (Jan
          2004), MOM4p0b (March 2004), MOM4p0c (August 2004), and
          MOM4p0d (May 2005). The developers welcome feedback, both
          positive and negative, on the code's integrity and
          portability as well as documentation. It is through such
          feedback that the code and documentation evolves and
          becomes more robust and user friendly.</p>
          <p>The purpose of this web guide is to provide general
          information about MOM4 and particular information for how
          to download and run the code.</p>

          <p>There are two major algorithm issues that are being
          addressed by GFDL developers. (1) Generalized
          quasi-Eulerian vertical coordinates are being implemented
          in MOM4. It is anticipated that MOM4p1a will have this
          capability, with a release date hopefully late 2005. (2)
          Two-way nesting is being considered for MOM. It is hoped
          that nesting will be available also late 2005 or early
          2006.</p>
          <p>There remains two general ways to compile mom4: with
          static allocation of arrays or dynamic allocation. Recent
          work on the SGI machines at GFDL has reduced the
          difference in efficiency between these two compilations.
          We understand that on some platforms, the dynamic
          allocation actually is better than static. Such remains
          an ongoing issue, as do other elements of code
          efficiency. Our general goal is to provide code that is
          efficient across a broad range of computer platforms, but
          not at the cost of sacrificing portability. Those who
          know they will be working with one particular platform
          for a period of time should readily find better ways of
          coding some parts of mom4 and the associated FMS code. If
          you feel your efficiency improvements are of a general
          nature and wish to have them distributed in future MOM4
          releases, we would be happy for you to contribute the
          modified code.</p>

          The documentation of most Fortran modules in FMS is
          inserted right in the source code to ensure consistency
          between the code and documentaion. A Perl software is
          used to extract documentation from the source code to
          create a corresponding .html module. For example,
          documentation for shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.F90
          module is shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.html. In
          general, the embedded documentation is a good starting
          point to understand the Fortran module. Here is a <a
          href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~gtn/module_doc.html"
          target="_top">complete tree</a> that depicts all

          <p>Although MOM4 shares much in common with earlier
          versions of MOM, it possesses a number of computational,
          numerical, and physical characteristics that are
          noteworthy. The following provides an overview of the
          main characteristics of MOM4 (please refer to <a href=
          "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~smg/pointers/geo_physics_abstracts/guide.pdf"
           target="_top">A Technical Guide to MOM4</a> for
          references).</p>
          <p>Computational characteristics of MOM4 include the
          following.</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>MOM4 is coded in Fortran 90 and physical units
              are MKS.</li>
              <li>MOM4 meets the code standards set by the GFDL
              Flexible Modeling System (<a href=
              "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~fms" target=
              "_top">FMS</a>). It also utilizes a substantial
              number of software infrastructure modules shared by
              other FMS-based models. In particular, all I/O (e.g.,
              restarts, forcing fields, initial fields) is handled
              via <a href=
              "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/"
              target="_top">NetCDF</a>.</li>
              <li>There is only a single cpp-preprocessor option
              (i.e., <tt class="option">ifdefs</tt>) associated
              with the handling of memory in the model. All options
              for physical and dynamical choices are handled via
              namelists and/or switching in/out of modules at
              compile time. Removing <tt class="option">ifdefs</tt>
              allows for more readable code that possesses a higher
              level of error checker handling.</li>
              <li>2D (latitudinal/longitudinal) horizontal domain
              decomposition is used for single or multiple parallel
              processors. Correspondingly, 3D arrays are
              dimensioned (i,j,k) instead of (i,k,j) used in
              earlier MOMs. MOM4 has no memory window or
              slabs.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>Numerical and kinematic/dynamic characteristics of
          MOM4 include the following.</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Generalized orthogonal horizontal coordinates are
              used. GFDL is supporting both the standard spherical
              coordinates as well as the ''tripolar'' grid of
              Murray (1996). Details are provided in <a href=
              "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~smg/pointers/geo_physics_abstracts/guide.pdf"
               target="_top">A Technical Guide to MOM4</a>.</li>
              <li>Bottom topography is represented using the
              partial cells of Pacanowski and Gnanadesikan (1998).
              The older full cell approach is available as a
              namelist in the preprocessing code used to generate
              the grid specification file.</li>
              <li>The dynamics/kinematics for MOM4p0a and MOM4p0b
              are based on the non-Boussinesq method of Greatbatch
              et al. (2002). The Boussinesq option is available via
              a namelist. This option was jettisoned in MOM4p0c for
              purposes of code brevity, and in anticipation of
              using pressure coordinates in MOM4p1 to realize
              non-Boussinesq dynamics.</li>
              <li>The time tendency for tracer and baroclinic
              velocity can be discretized two ways. (1) The first
              approach uses the traditional leap-frog method along
              with a Robert-Asselin time filter. Note that the
              Euler forward or Euler backward mixing time step used
              in earlier MOMs has been eliminated. This method is
              avalable in MOM4p0a, MOM4p0b and MOM4p0c. (2) MOM4p0c
              provides an additional method, which is strongly
              recommended. Here, the time tendency is discretized
              with a two-level forward step, which eliminates the
              need to time filter. Tracer and velocity are
              staggered in time, thus providing second order
              accuracy in time. For certain model configurations,
              this scheme is roughly twice as stable as the
              leap-frog, thus allowing for a factor of two in
              computational savings. Without the time filtering
              needed with the leap-frog, the new scheme conserves
              total tracer to within numerical roundoff. This
              scheme shares much in common with time stepping used
              in the Hallberg Isopycnal Model and the MIT GCM. It
              is the default in MOM4p0c. Details of both the
              leap-frog and two-level schemes are provided in <a
              href="http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html"
              target="_top">Fundamentals of Ocean Climate
              Models</a>.</li>
              <li>The sole external mode solver is a variant of the
              Griffies et al. (2001) explicit free surface. There
              are two time stepping schemes supported: (1)
              leap-frog and (2) predictor-corrector. The
              predictor-corrector is more stable and is thus the
              default method. Top model grid cells have time
              dependent volume, thus allowing for total tracer to
              be conserved to within roundoff. The linearized free
              surface method used in MOM3 (and many other
              implementations of the free surface in z-models) has
              been jettisoned since it precludes tracer
              conservation. Details are provided in <a href=
              "http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html" target=
              "_top">Fundamentals of Ocean Climate Models</a>.</li>
              <li>McDougall et al. (2003) equation of state has
              been implemented, with in situ density a function of
              the local potential temperature, salinity, and
              hydrostatic pressure (baroclinic pressure plus free
              surface pressure plus applied pressure from the
              atmosphere and sea ice). Details are provided in <a
              href="http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html"
              target="_top">Fundamentals of Ocean Climate
              Models</a>.</li>
              <li>Tracer advection is available using various
              schemes. The centered 2nd, 4th, 6th order schemes are
              available, as documented in <a href=
              "http://www.gfdl.gov/~smg/MOM/web/guide_parent/guide_parent.html"
               target="_top">The MOM3 Manual of Pacanowski and
              Griffies (1999)</a>. The 4th and 6th order schemes
              assume constant grid spacing, which simplifies the
              code though compromises accuracy on the more commonly
              used non-uniform grids. The Quicker scheme documented
              by Holland et al. (1998) and <a href=
              "http://www.gfdl.gov/~smg/MOM/web/guide_parent/guide_parent.html"
               target="_top">The MOM3 Manual</a> is available.
              Finally, two multi-dimensional flux limited schemes
              have been ported from the MIT GCM. These schemes are
              monotonic and have been found to be roughly the same
              cost as the Quicker scheme. GFDL researchers have
              found the Sweby scheme to be most satisfying for many
              applications, such as biogeochemistry. Hence, effort
              has been made to enhance this scheme's efficiency in
              MOM4p0c. Other schemes remain much as they were with
              the MOM4p0a release.</li>
              <li>Tidal forcing from the various lunar and solar
              components are available to force the free ocean
              surface.</li>
              <li>Open boundary conditions are available to allow
              open boundaries in either of the north, south, east,
              or west directions.</li>

              <li>Topographically oriented tracer diffusion
              introduces enhanced diffusion when heavy parcels are

              <li>MOM4 comes with three tracer packages: (1) ideal
              age tracer (2) tracers for the OCMIP biotic protocol
              (3) CFC tracers. Additionally, a suite of code is
              available for handling tracers inside MOM4 and FMS
              shared code (<tt class="filename"><a href=

              provides the user with many options for adding new
              tracer packages, ecosystem models, etc.</li>
              <li>MOM4 has numerous diagnostics for checking
              algorithm and solution integrity. These diagnostics
              include budgets for energetic consistency, tracer
              conservation, solution stability, etc. Additional
              diagnostics are available for numerous fields of
              relevance to the different physics schemes, as well
              as term balances.</li>
              <li>MOM4 is distributed with a prognostic sea ice
              model (SIS) via mom4_test4 and mom4_test5.</li>
              <li>As a forward model, MOM4 is compatible with the

          <p>MOM4 has been coded within GFDL's Flexible Modeling
          System (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~fms" target=
          "_top">FMS</a>). Doing so allows for MOM4 developers to
          use numerous FMS infrastructure and superstructure
          modules that are shared amongst various atmospheric,
          ocean, sea ice, land, vegetative, etc. models. Common
          standards and shared software tools facilitate the
          development of high-end earth system models, which
          necessarily involves a wide variety of researchers
          working on different computational platforms. Such
          standards also foster efficient input from computational
          scientists and engineers as they can more readily focus
          on common computational issues.</p>

          consists of a flat bottom sector domain and uses very
          simple physics. This experiment is very small and can be
          easily run on a single workstation. It should provide the

          <p><tt class="filename">mom4_test2</tt>: This experiment
          consists of a flat bottom sector domain and it uses more
          realistic physics options. This experiment has the same
          grid as <tt class="filename">test1</tt>, but it more
          thoroughly exercises the model's various physics
          packages. Since the domain is small, it should be
          accessible to those with single workstations, though it
          will be slower than mom4_test1 due to the use of more
          realistic physical parameterizations.</p>
          <p><tt class="filename">mom4_test3A</tt>: This experiment
          consists of an east-west channel using open boundary
          conditions at the western end of the channel. This
          experiment provides an illustration of the open boundary
          condition capability of MOM4. Tracers include potential
          temperature and salinity.</p>
          <p><tt class="filename">mom4_test3B</tt>: This experiment
          consists of an solid wall on all four sides and with a
          domain twice as long as the open boundary condition <tt
          class="filename">test3A</tt>. This experiment is used to
          verify the relevance of the open boundary solution from
          <tt class="filename">test3A</tt> solution at early times.
          That is, for early times, the solution from <tt class=
          "filename">test3A</tt> should closely (though not
          bitwise) agree with that from <tt class=
          "filename">test3B</tt>. Tracers include potential
          temperature and salinity.</p>
          <p><tt class="filename">mom4_test4</tt>: This model uses
          a global tripolar grid with roughly "3-degree" resolution
          and 28 vertical levels. The ocean is coupled to the GFDL
          sea ice model. Tracers include temperature and salinity,
          as well as the age, OCMIP biotic, and cfc tracer
          packages. This model is aimed to test the capabilities of
          the multipe tracers available with mom4. Note that the
          Sweby advection scheme is used here for all tracers, as
          is recommended by GFDL researchers.</p>
          <p><tt class="filename">mom4_test5</tt>: This model uses
          a global tripolar grid with roughly "1-degree" resolution
          and 50 vertical levels. The ocean is coupled to the GFDL
          sea ice model. The configuration is forced with the
          German OMIP dataset. Ocean tracers include potential
          temperature and salinity as well as the age tracer
          package. This is a large model, and it is similar (though
          not the same) to the ocean and ice configuration used for
          the GFDL IPCC simulations.</p>

        <p>As with previous MOMs, the GFDL-MOM4 developers aim to
        provide the international climate research community with a
        repository for robust and well documented methods to
        simulate the ocean climate system. Consequently, we
        encourage researchers to support various modules that are
        presently absent from MOM4, yet may arguably enhance the
        simulation integrity (e.g., a new physical parameterization
        or new advection scheme) or increase the model's
        functionality.</p>
        <p>Depending on the level of code contributions, we
        envision a directory where "contributed MOM4 code" will
        reside. Maintenance and ownership of this code will remain
        with the contributor. As a practical matter, prior to
        spending time developing a new module, it is recommended
        that the developer query the <a href=
        "mailto:oar.gfdl.mom4p0@noaa.gov" target="_top">MOM4
        mailing list</a> to see what efforts in the community may
        have already been availed.</p>

        <p>MOM4 is distributed with code used to generate model
        grids, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Each
        step must be performed prior to running the ocean model.
        The steps used during this experimental setup stage are
        generally termed "preprocessing", and the code used for
        these purposes is under the /preprocessing directory in the
        mom4 distribution. The purpose of this section of the User
        Guide is to outline this code and its usage. Further
        details of usage and algorithms can be found in the
        internal documentation within the various preprocessing
        code modules.</p>

          <p>We start this section with some general comments
          regarding the setup of a model experiment.</p>
          <p>--Setting up an experiment is critical part to the
          success of a research or development project with mom4.
          It is important that the user take some time to
          understand each of the many steps, and scrutinize the
          output from this code.</p>
          <p>We have endeavoured over the years to provide tools
          facilitating the ready setup of a new experiment.
          However, we remain unable to provide code that does
          everything possible under the sun. Additionally, all
          features that are provided here may not be fully tested.
          For these reasons, the preprocessing code continues to
          evolve as use and functionality evolve. We sincerely
          appreciate ALL comments about code and documentation,
          especially comments regarding clarity, completeness, and
          correctness. Your input is essential for the improvement
          of the code and documentation.</p>
          <p>--Many steps in idealized experiments that were
          formerly performed while running earlier MOM versions
          have been extracted from mom4 and placed into
          preprocessing. Hence, even if you are running an
          idealized experiment, it is likely that you will need to
          perform some if not all of the preprocessing steps
          discussed here.</p>
          <p>--In addition to this section discussing how to set up
          an experiment, the online USER GUIDE has a <a href=
          "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~gtn/mom4_faq.html" target=
          "_top">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> section
          devoted to these issues. If you have a problem that is
          not addressed either here or the FAQ, then please feel
          free to query the mom4 email list. No question is too
          silly, so please ask!</p>
          <p>--All code used to setup an experiment with mom4 is
          written in Fortran 90/95 except make_xgrids, which is
          written in C. Most code is dependent on FMS shared code
          for the purpose of parallization and interpolation. In
          addition to the documentation provided here and <a href=
          "http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~gtn/mom4_faq.html" target=
          "_top">FAQs</a>, there are comments within the code to
          help users debug and to make modifications to suit their
          purpose.</p>
          <p>--Some users make nontrivial changes of general use.
          With your support, assistance, and maintenance, we will
          endeavour to include your changes in future releases.</p>

          </span> <span><b class="command">make_xgrids</b></span>
          takes care that the land and ocean grids perfectly tile
          the sphere. The land model's domain is defined as the
          part of the sphere not covered by ocean (where wet = 0 on
          the ocean grid). To accomplish this, the land cells must
          be modified to remove the ocean parts. This is done in
          <span><b class="command">make_xgrids</b></span> by first
          taking the intersections of atmosphere and land cells.
          The overlap area between these cells and active ocean
          cells are then subtracted. Finally, the modified
          atmosphere/land intersections are aggregated into land
          cell areas and atmosphere/land exchange cell areas.</p>
          <p>Model cell intersections are calculated using the
          Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm
          (Sutherland, I. E. and G. W. Hodgeman, 1974: Reentrant
          polygon clipping, CACM, 17(1), 32-42.). This algorithm
          finds the intersection of a convex and arbitrary polygon
          by successively removing the portion of the latter that
          is "outside" each boundary of the former. It can be found
          in many computer graphics text books (e.g., Foley, J. D.,
          A. van Dam, S. K. Feiner, and J. F. Hughes, 1990:
          Computer graphics: principles and practice, second
          edition. Addison Wesley, 1174 pp.). The implementation in
          <span><b class="command">make_xgrids</b></span> is
          particularly simple because the clipping polygon is
          always a rectangle in longitude/latitude space. For the
          purpose of finding the line intersections in the clipping
          operations, the cell boundaries are assumed to be
          straight lines in longitude/latitude space. This
          treatment is only perfectly accurate for cells bounded by
          lines of longitude and latitude.</p>
          <p>Spherical areas are calculated by taking the integral
          of the negative sine of latitude around the boundary of a
          polygon (Jones, P. W., 1999: First- and second-order
          conservative remapping schemes for grids in spherical
          coordinates. Monthly Weather Review, 127, 2204-2210.).
          The integration pathways are again straight lines in
          longitude/latitude space. <span><b class=
          "command">make_xgrids</b></span> checks that the sphere
          and the individual cells of the atmosphere and ocean
          grids are tiled by the surface exchange cells. The
          fractional tiling errors are reported.</p>

          <p>After generating the model grid, it is time to
          generate the initial and boundary conditions (ICs and
          BCs). These conditions are specific to the details of the
          model grid, so it is necessary to have the grid
          specificiation file in hand before moving to the IC and
          BC generation.</p>
          <p>There are two options for ICs and BCs.</p>
          <p>--Idealized Conditions. These conditions are based on
          subroutines that design idealized setups for either
          initial conditions (e.g., exponential temperature
          profile) or boundary conditions (e.g., cosine zonal wind
          stress). Code for these purposes is found in the
          idealized_ic and idealized_bc directories in the mom4
          distribution. Details of available namelist choices are
          in the documentation file idealized_ic.html as well as
          the comments within the source code itself. Users can
          readily incorporate their favorite idealized IC or BC
          into the mom4 idealized preprocessing step by emulating
          the code provided.</p>
          <p>--Realistic Conditions. These ICs and BCs generally
          result from a regridding routine to bring, say, the
          Levitus analysis onto the model grid for initializing a
          model, or for mapping surface fluxes onto the grid for
          boundary conditions. Code enabling the regridding
          functions is found in the preprocessing/regrid_2d,
          preprocessing/regrid_3d and preprocessing/regrid
          directories in the mom4 distribution.</p>
          <p>In the remainder of this section, we detail code to
          generate the ICs and BCs of use for mom4.</p>

            </div>
            <p>It is typical for air-sea fluxes of momentum, heat,
            and mosture to live on a grid distinct from the ocean
            model grid. In particular, most analyses are placed on
            a spherical latitude-longitude grid, whereas most
            global ocean models configured from mom4 are run with
            tripolar grids.</p>
            <p>When running an ocean or ocean-ice model, it is
            useful to map the boundary fluxes onto the ocean model
            grid prior to the experiment. This preprocessing step
            saves computational time that would otherwise be needed
            if the fluxes were mapped each time step of a running
            experiment. To enable this regridding, one should
            access code in the preprocessing/regrid_2d directory.
            The original data must be on a latitude-longitude grid
            to use regrid_2d. The target/destination grid can be
            either latitude-longitude with arbitrary resolution, or
            tripolar with arbitrary resolution.</p>

            <p>In some cases, one may wish to take a set of forcing
            fields from one tripolar mom4 experiment and regrid
            them onto another tripolar mom4 experiment with
            different grid resolution. In this case, it is
            necessary to regrid before running the experiment.</p>
            <p>As of the mom4p0d distribution, there is a
            regridding tool within the preprocessing/regrid
            directory that enables one to regrid fields on one
            tripolar grid to another tripolar grid. Indeed, one can
            regrid source data from any logically rectangular grid
            (e.g., latitude-longitude grid or tripolar grid) to a
            target/destination grid that is any logically
            rectangular grid.</p>
            <p>Note that this is new code, and so has been tested
            only for particular cases. So the user should be extra
            careful to scrutinize the results.</p>

            allowed ONLY if the input data lives on a spherical

            the input data on their native spherical grid. If the

            this case, runoff is moved to a nearest ocean/land
            boundary point on the new grid. Note that the source
            runoff dataset must be on a spherical
            latitude-longitude grid, whereas the target/destination
            grid can be spherical or tripolar. The regridding
            algorithm is conservative.</p>
            <p>The conservative regridding scheme used in
            runoff_regrid is an area average scheme, which is
            similiar to the algorithm used in coupler flux
            exchange. If any land point has runoff data, after
            remapping runoff data onto destination grid, the runoff
            value of that land point will be moved to the nearest
            ocean point. Before using this tool, you must use
            make_xgrids to generate exchange grid information
            between the source grid and destination grid. The

            </div>
            <p>There are two ways to specify surface boundary
            fluxes when using the coupler feature of FMS. One is
            through flux exchange, and this employs a conservative
            algorithm as appropriate for running a coupled
            ocean-atmosphere model. It is assumed that the
            atmospheric model grid is spherical with arbitrary
            resolution. The other method is through data override,
            and this uses a non-conservative scheme. Data override
            is of use to selectively remove, say, one of the fluxes
            coming from an atmospheric model and replace this flux
            with that from data. GFDL modelers have found this
            feature to be very useful in diagnosing problems with a
            coupled model.</p>

            <p>When generating realistic initial conditions for an
            ocean experiment, one generally requires the gridding
            of temperature and salinity, such as from the Levitus
            analysis product, onto the model's grid. For this
            purpose, we are in need of vertical grid information in
            addition to horizontal 2d information required for the
            surface boundary conditions. Hence, we use the
            preprocessing/regrid_3d. A similar procedure is
            required to develop sponge data.</p>
            <p>The original data must be on a spherical grid in
            order to use regrid_3d. If the original data is on a
            tripolar grid, we should use preprocessing/regrid,
            which can map data from any logical rectangular grid
            onto any logical rectangular grid.</p>

            </div>
            <p>For preprocessing/regrid_3d, preprocessing/regrid_2d
            and preprocessing/regrid, regridding is accomplished
            non-conservatively using a nearest neighbor distance
            weighting algorithm, or bilinear interpolation. The
            interpolation algorithm is controlled through the
            namelist option "interp_method".</p>
            <p>Bilinear interpolation is recommanded for most cases
            since it provides a smooth interpolation when
            regridding from coarse grid to fine grid (the usual
            situation with model destination grids typically having
            resolution more refined than source data products), and
            it is more efficient. Efficiency can become a
            particularly important issue when developing initial
            and boundary conditions for a refined resolution
            model.</p>
            <p>If the original data is on a tripolar grid, nearest
            neighbor distance weighting interpolation found in
            preprocessing/regrid must be used, since bilinear
            interpolation assumes the original data is on a
            latitude-longitude grid. For preprocessing/regrid_2d,
            preprocessing/regrid_3d and preprocessing/regrid using
            the nearest neighbor distance weighting algorithm, a
            maximum distance (in radians) can be selected using the
            namelist value max_dist. Namelist option "num_nbrs" can
            be adjusted for speed, although for most applications
            this refinement is not necessary.</p>

            MOM4 requires its forcing data to have an explicit
            specification of a calendar type. If the calendar type
            is absent, the model is brought down. This method is
            considered a safe way to enforce some knowledge of the
            calender used when running a model, rather than to let
            the user assume one calendar when the data is actually
            another. Serious problems have been encountered with
            use of the wrong calendar type, and we encourage
            modelers to pay attention to this detail when running
            realistic simulations. 
            <p>For technical reasons, the code used to create
            idealized boundary conditions in the preprocessing
            directory does not specify a calendar attribute. It is
            therefore up to the user to do so via a netcdf utility
            applied to the resulting netcdf file. For example, when
            creating idealized cosine wind stress, one needs to
            specify a calendar, such as a 365 day (noleap) year,
            using the following command</p>
            <span><b class="command">ncatted -h -a
            calendar_type,TIME,c,c,'NOLEAP' tau.nc</b></span> 
            <p>In future versions of the preprocessing code, we
            will provide namelist options for adding the calendar.
            For now, the user must provide this information using
            the above method with netcdf commands.</p>

          <p>For many analysis applications, it is sufficient, and
          often preferable, to have output on the model's native
          grid (i.e., the grid used to run the simulation).
          Accurate computation of budgets, for example, must be
          done on the model's native grid, preferably online during
          integration. MOM4 provides numerous online diagnostics
          for this purpose.</p>
          <p>Many applications, such as model comparison projects,
          require results on a common latitude-longitude spherical
          grid. Such facilitates the development of difference
          maps. For this purpose, we have developed a tool to
          regrid scalar and vector fields from a tripolar grid to a
          spherical grid. In principle, this tool can be used to
          regrid any logically rectangular gridded field onto a
          spherical grid. However, applications at GFDL have been
          limited to the tripolar to spherical regrid case.</p>
          <p>In general, regridding is a difficult task to perform
          accurately and without producing noise or spurious
          results. The user should carefully examine regridding
          results for their physical integrity. Problems occur, in
          particular, with fields near mom4's partial bottom step
          topography in the presence of realistic topography and
          land/sea geometry. Indeed, we were unable to find a
          simple algorithm to handle regridding in the vertical
          that did not produce egregious levels of noise. Hence,
          the regridding tool provided with mom4 only handles
          horizontal regridding. The regridded data will thus be on
          the source vertical grid.</p>
          <p>Model comparisons should ideally be performed only
          after regridding output using the same regridding
          algorithm. Unfortunately, such is not generally the case
          since there is no standard regridding algorithm used in
          the modeling community.</p>
          <p>Please note that the regridding code is relatively new
          at GFDL. We greatly appreciate user's feedback.</p>

          <p>The algorithm accepts data from any logically
          rectangular grid (e.g., tripolar or latitude-longitude)
          and regrids to a spherical latitude-longitude grid. When
          the data is on the tracer cell (T-cell), the regridding
          interpolation is conservative. Thus, total heat, salt,
          and passive tracer remain the same on the two grids.
          However, when data is located at another position:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">

              flux</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>then regridding is accomplished non-conservatively
          using a nearest neighbor distance weighting algorithm. It
          is for this reason that compuationally accurate results
          are only available when working on the model's native
          grids.</p>
          <p>The regridding tool reads grids information from a
          netcdf file, specified by the namelist "grid_spec_file".

              grid is know as "make_xgrids". It is located in the

          <p>It is critical that src_grid.nc DO NOT already have
          any of the above new exchange grid fields. If they do,
          then these fields should be removed using netcdf <a href=
          "http://nco.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">tools</a>
          such as ncks.</p>
          <p>After the grid_spec.nc file is generated, it is passed
          into the regrid program through the nml option
          "grid_spec_file".</p>
          <p>The regrid program reads model data from a netcdf
          file, which is specfied by the namelist variable
          "src_data". Again, src_data fields are gridded according
          to src_grid.nc. The number of fields to be regridded is
          specified by num_flds. The name of the fields (e.g.,
          temp, salt) to be regridded is specified by the namelist
          variable "fld_name". Each field can be a scalar or
          vector. If a vector, then specify by vector_fld. Vector
          fields should always be paired together (e.g., u,v
          components to the horizontal current). The output file is
          a netcdf file specified by the namelist variable
          "dst_data".</p>
          <p>The complete namelist option description is available
          in regrid.html or the code itself.</p>

          <p>In the first section of the field table, the user can
          specify tracers to be used in the simulation. Although
          there is no limit to the number of tracers specified,
          temperature (<tt class="literal">temp</tt>) and salinity
          (<tt class="literal">salt</tt>) must be included. The
          user may also define the horizontal and vertical tracer
          advection schemes. For more information on the field
          manager, reference <a href=
          "../src/shared/field_manager/field_manager.html" target=
          "_top">field_manager.html</a>.</p>
          <p>In climate modeling, it is often necessary to allow
          water masses that are separated by land to exchange
          tracer and surface height properties. This situation
          arises in models when the grid mesh is too coarse to
          resolve narrow passageways that in reality provide
          crucial connections between water masses. The cross-land
          mixing and cross-land insertion establishes communication
          between bodies of water separated by land. The
          communication consists of mixing tracers and volume
          between non-adjacent water columns. Momentum is not
          mixed. The scheme conserves total tracer content, total
          volume, and maintains compatibility between the tracer
          and volume budgets. The grid points where this exchange
          takes place, and the rates of the exchange, are specified
          in the field table.</p>
          <p>For some cases, it is necessary to set a large
          vertical tracer diffusivity at a specified point in the
          model, say next to a river mouth to ensure fresh water is
          mixed vertically. These diffusivities are specified in
          the field table.</p>

          mixing and insertion, please reference <a href=

          are classified into three subdirectories:</p>

          <p>There are several graphical packages available to
          display the model output. These packages vary widely
          depending on factors, such as the number of dimensions,
          the amount and complexity of options available and the
          output data format. The data will first have to be put
          into a common format that all the packages can read. FMS
          requires the data to be stored in <a href=
          "http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/" target=
          "_top">NetCDF</a> format since it is so widely supported
          for scientific visualization. The graphical package is
          also dependent upon the computing environment. For ocean
          modeling, <a href=

        <p>An often frustrating aspect of numerical modeling is
        getting the computational environment set up so the model
        compiles, executes, completes, and saves data in a smooth
        and dependable manner. There are numerous platform
        configurations, compiler variations, data storage
        capabilities, and experimental designs that make it likely
        that each user will encounter unique issues.</p>
        <p>At GFDL, we try to develop code that is portable and
        readily usable on many platforms. Nonetheless, given the
        multitude of configurations, we cannot anticipate all
        problems. So users should expect to spend some time setting
        up the model's computational environment when downloading
        the code for the first time.</p>
        <p>We rely on users within the mom4 community to provide
        feedback regarding how they got the model to run on their
        respective platforms. We greatly appreciate when users send
        their "progress report" to the mom4 email list. We solicit
        information on issues that may make future releases less
        problematic. We also appreciate your detailed documentation
        that may approach "hand holding" to better allow new users
        to successfully run the model. Indeed, imagine being a
        fresh graduate student or postdoc, only just recently
        learning Unix and Fortran, aiming to download and run mom4
        on their PC! The more experienced users share knowledge in
        a digested and organized manner, the easier it will be for
        others to realize success with the code.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this section is to organize some of the
        many emails that have been sent to the mom4 email list that
        focus on computational platform issues. Given limited
        resources and limited access to platforms outside GFDL, we
        have not edited these emails. Users who wish to update or
        edit information provided in an earlier email please feel
        free to do so.</p>
        <p><span><b class="command">NOTE</b></span>: Some platform
        related problems may have already been solved in the latest

        <p>MOM4 is an evolving code. As features are added or
        removed, bugs are resolved, and documentation clarified, we
        aim to provide the user community with access to our latest
        code used in-house at GFDL. The purpose of this section is
        to summarize the main features of each model version.</p>
        <p>For new users, please download the most recent release.
        For those having used mom4 for sometime, your need to
        update should be based on a balance between accessing new
        features or bug fixes versus the overhead needed to update
        your respective model experiments. It is recommended that
        you access new versions of mom4 only after completion of a
        particular line of research, rather than updating in the
        middle. Notably, we do not ensure that each update is fully
        backwards compatible.</p>

          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>The time tendency for tracer and baroclinic
              velocity can be discretized two ways. (1) The first
              approach uses the traditional leap-frog method along
              with a Robert-Asselin time filter. (2) MOM4p0c
              provides an additional method, which is strongly
              recommended. Here, the time tendency is discretized
              with a two-level forward step, which eliminates the
              need to time filter. Tracer and velocity are
              staggered in time, thus providing second order
              accuracy in time. For certain model configurations,
              this scheme is roughly twice as stable as the
              leap-frog, thus allowing for a factor of two in
              computational savings. Without the time filtering
              needed with the leap-frog, the new scheme conserves
              total tracer to within numerical roundoff. Extensive
              tests indicate that the simulations are quite similar
              qualitatively and quantitatively to those run with
              the leap-frog scheme. However, the user is encouraged
              to verify such prior to moving forward with the new
              time stepping scheme. Note that the new scheme shares
              much in common with time stepping used in the
              Hallberg Isopycnal Model and the MIT GCM. This new
              scheme is the default in MOM4p0c.</li>
              <li>The barotropic mode can be updated using either
              the older leap-frog method, or a newer defaulted
              predictor-corrector method motivated by a similar
              method used in the Hallberg Isopycnal Model.</li>
              <li>Thickness weighted tracer concentration and
              thickness weighted baroclinic velocity are updated,
              rather than tracer concentration and velocity. This
              new approach provides simpler conservation budgets,
              in which there is no longer a source-like term
              associated with the time tendency of the surface
              height.</li>
              <li>Optimizations have been implemented to reduce
              array syntax and to improve parallelization. This
              work is ongoing, with assistance from the MOM4 user
              community greatly appreciated.</li>
              <li>A new derived type has been introduced:
              ocean_thickness_type. This type absorbs elements of
              the ocean_grid_type that invove time dependent
              thicknesses of layers. It is anticipated that this
              type will expand in the future as MOM4 evolves
              towards generalized vertical coordinates. This change
              required interfaces changes.</li>
              <li>The Time derived type has been removed from the
              other derived types in order to simplify the
              definitions of the types. This change required
              interfaces changes.</li>
              <li>The non-Boussinesq option has been jettisoned in
              order to simplify some of the code. It is anticipated
              that the next release of MOM4 will be MOM4p1 (late
              2004 or early 2005), and this code will include a
              pressure-coordinate option to allow for simpler
              implementation of non-Boussinesq
              kinematics/dynamics.</li>

          <p>New features of the FMS infrastructure</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Extensive work has been included to enhance the
              portability and flexibility of FMS codes. This work
              is ongoing, with assistance from the MOM4 user
              community greatly appreciated.</li>
              <li>The new version of <a href=
              "../src/shared/time_manager/time_manager.html"
              target="_top"><tt class=
              "filename">shared/time_manager.f90</tt></a> requires
              that every dataset with a time dimension also have a
              calendar attribute associated with this time. This
              new attribute is now required because problems were
              found with the old time manager when running the
              model assuming a repeating annual cycle using the
              NOLEAP calendar type, yet without the datasets also
              having this calendar type. A spurious shift in the
              date accumulated over time, which caused shifts in
              the forcing relative to what the model intended. The
              calendar attribute is missing from many datasets
              released with mom4p0a and mom4p0b. Since the missing
              of calendar attribute would cause a fatal error in
              mom4p0c release, NEW datasets that have calendar
              attribute are required for mom4p0c release.</li>
              <li>Because getting NetCDF datasets in a proper
              format for FMS code remains a frustrating aspect of
              running MOM4, we have provided a new stand-alone
              utility that tests a data file for compatibility with
              FMS. This utility is in <a href=
              "../src/shared/time_interp/time_interp_external.html"
              target="_top"><tt class=
              "filename">shared/time_interp_external.F90</tt></a>
              and there is an associated run script at
              src/preprocessing/test_time_interp_ext that the user
              should modify for their machines. Use of this utility
              to debug the datasets prior to running MOM4 can help
              to remove a significant level of frustration
              associated with building a new model with new
              datasets.</li>
              <li>Another substantial update to the FMS
              infrastructure involves the mpp code, such as <a
              href="../src/shared/mpp/mpp.html" target="_top"><tt
              class="filename">shared/mpp.F90</tt></a> . This code
              has been significantly reorganized for easier
              understanding, and many new features have been added.
              One new feature that has been found quite useful is
              that it is now possible to update a set of fields
              across processors after accumulating the full set,
              rather than sending each member individually. In
              general, sending one very large package of data for
              mpp_update_domains is far more efficient than sending
              multiple smaller packages. This new feature is most
              useful, for example, when sending multiple tracers or
              tracer tendencies for updates in modules such as
              ocean_neutral_physics.F90 and tracer advection. (Note
              that only the Sweby advection scheme has been
              modified to allow for this improved efficiency. Other
              schemes can be modified similarly. Since they are not
              commonly used at GFDL, they have not been
              modified).</li>

              <li>In mom4p0d release the Frequently Asked Questions
              (FAQ) have been extensively rewritten. The new <a

                <p>ocean_core/ocean_freesurf.F90</p>
                - always initialize the tidal forcing, as
                tidal_forcing_init allocates some arrays which are
                used with the dynamical allocation model.

                <p>mom4/ocean_core/ocean_grids.F90</p>
                - add namelist option beta_plane and f_plane in
                ocean_grids_nml. With default value false.
                <p>- fix bug that some diagnostics data axis is not

                <p>- add namelist do_bitwise_exact_sum to the
                diagnostic module. Set true to do bitwise exact
                global sum. When it is false, the global sum will
                be non-bitwise-exact, but will significantly
                increase efficiency. The default value is
                false.</p>

                ocean_param/mixing/neutral/ocean_neutral_physics.F90</p>
                - removed unnecessary memory allocation when
                neutral physics is not used. 
                <p>- fixed incorrect index.</p>
                - corrected update_domain for ustar and vstar, will
                not change answer, only affect diagnostics

                <p>ocean_diag/ocean_adv_vel_diag.F90</p>
                - added Fortran intrinsic functions "maxloc" and
                "minloc" in a new algorithm for computing
                tracer_min_max and/or maximum CFL number. These
                intrinsic functions allow for more vectorized
                algorithms, so should see some efficiency
                improvement especially on vector machines.

              <li>A few minor changes have been made to MPP. Some
              have to do with extending shared memory functionality

                <p>- eliminate the need to pass Time to send_data
                for static fields</p>
                <p>- add code that writes the meta data associated
                with register fields to an ascii file called

                <p>shared/axis_utils/axis_utils.F90</p>
                add a test program test_axis_utils. Remove
                unnecessary input grid to avoid bad data in the
                input data. It shouldn't change solution for any
                present experiments.

                <p>shared/time_interp/time_interp_external.F90</p>

                shared/horiz_interp/horiz_interp_spherical.f90</p>
                add a namelist "search_method" to
                horiz_interp_spherical_nml. The reason is that the
                radial search may be not quite accurate in some
                cases. In this situation, you can always set
                search_method to "full_search", which will be
                always accurate but less efficiency comparing to
                "radial_search". "radial_search" is the default
                value. In most cases, "radial_search" and
                "full_search" will produce same results other than
                order of operation. With "radial_search", it is
                important to choose suitable max_dist (an optional
                argument in horiz_interp_spherical_init).

                destination grid have different vertical grid.
                Replace apply_dest_mask with apply_mask to add the
                option to allow source data mask to determine

          Removed namelist do_vertical_interp. This tool will not
