<title>MOM4 test cases</title>

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
    How seriously should I take the mom4-test cases?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
    The mom4-test cases are not well tuned models. Hence, they generally will
    not result in physically meaningful simulations. Additionally, the models
    may crash if run for longer than suggested in the distributed run scripts.
    That is, the test cases are supported <emphasis>ONLY</emphasis> for testing
    the integrity of the code on various platforms (i.e., does the code compile
    and run for a few time steps?). <emphasis>PLEASE PLEASE</emphasis> do not
    take the test cases and write papers based on them. We are not providing
    models--instead we are providing code.

 <question>
  <para>
 In test5, I notice axes X and Y in files are not the same between files ice_month.nc and
ocean_month.nc, why?
 </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
 The reason is that ice model and ocean model use different axis. The ocean 
model simply just uses the grid axis gridlon_t/gridlat_t of the grid spec file 
as the diag axis of the output file. The ice model uses the average of the 
geographical longitude/latitude average along j-index/i-index. When the grid 
is  tripolar grid, these two will have different axis.

I run test4 with non_boussinesq=true, then I got this error:
      "fms_io,read_data_3d_new:field rho_nbt NOT found in file  INPUT/ocean_density.res.nc"
	what could be the problem here? can test4 run with non_boussinesq option?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
It is probable that you are starting your non-boussinesq run from a restart
generated from the Boussinesq.  That is the problem.  The Boussinesq
restart does not have the extra rho_nbt variable saved, so the model
bombs when switching to the non-Boussinesq in the middle of your run.
</para><para>
Two options:
 <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
 restart from initial conditions, where the model will not need the
rho_nbt at time-0.
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
 modify the restart file by adding a rho_nbt variable.  To get started,
simply let rho_nbt=1035.
 </listitem>

There is no fundamental reason that test4 cannot run non-Boussinesq.

 <question>
  <para>
I have started a new experiment that is similar to one of the mom4
test cases, can I simply use the namelists in the input directory of mom4 test?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
You may need to change coupler_nml dt_ocean if using the <filename>coupler_main</filename> to
drive the ocean, or dt_ocean in ocean_solo_nml if using the <filename>ocean_solo.F90</filename>
to drive the ocean. The model time steps generally need to change when
changing grid resolution. Also, if you alter the layout of the parallel
processors used to run the model, then you may need to change 
ocean_model_nml
layout. </para><para>
So, in general, the test case namelists will need to be changed both for
computational and physical reasons. Please do not assume that
all is directly transferrable to your new experiment configuration.

 <question>
  <para>
Can I simply use the diag_table in the input directory of mom4 test?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
The diag_table sets up the diagnostics to be saved during the model
integration. If you wish to add or remove some of the diagnostics,
then the diag_table will need to be changed.  mom4 provides numerous
possible diagnostics, so do not assume those fields that are enabled in the diag_table
examples are all that are available.
  </para>
 </answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
Can I simply use the field_table in the input directory of mom4 test?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
The field table sets up certain numerical and initial conditions for the
tracer fields.  Many different advection algorithms are set here, as 
well as certain idealized initial conditions (e.g., constant tracer).
The field_table provided in the mom4 tests may happen to be fine for your 
purposes.  But such assumption is not guaranteed.

 </answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
Can I simply use the data_table in the input directory of mom4 test?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
The data_table is used to bring in forcing fields from datasets to run the 
ocean model.  The file names and the field names of your forcing fields 
will generally be different from those in the mom4 tests.  Remember that 
if you wish to run with on_grid=.false. for a particular field, then the 
dataset must be in spherical grid.  The exchange grid algorithm assumes that the 
source field is on a spherical grid as it interpolates to the mom4 
spherical or tripolar grids.
  </para>
 </answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
Can I simply use the forcing datasets of mom4 test?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
If your model grid is the same as that of a mom4 test, then the answer
is "yes".
</para><para>
If your grid is different, then you can use the mom4 forcing data if 
it is on a spherical grid and you set "on_grid=.false." in the 
data_table.  If the mom4 forcing data is on a tripolar grid, then you 
cannot use this data since the bilinear horizontal
interpolation algorithm can only interpolate from a spherical source 
grid to a spherical or tripolar target grid.  In this case, you must 
regenerate the forcing by following the prodecure discussed in the 
preprocessing section of this user guide.

 <question>
  <para>
Can I use the initial conditions from a mom4 test?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
If your model grid is the same as that of the mom4 test, then "yes".
</para><para>
If your grid is different, then "no".  You must generate the initial 
conditions on the model grid prior to running.  Note that if one wishes 
to start the model with constant tracers, then it is possible to do so 
via the appropriate setting in the field_table.  More nontrivial initial 
conditions must be generated from either one of the idealized_ic in the 
preprocessing portion of the mom4 distribution, or by remapping 
realistic fields onto the model grid using the remap_3d functionality 
(again in the preprocessing code).

 <question>
  <para>
Which tools should I use to generate my own forcing data sets?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
All forcing data can be mapped onto the model grid once the grid_spec.nc 
file has been generated.
</para><para>
   a) Idealized 3-D data (initial conditions) can be generated through 
<filename> preprocessing/mom4_prep/idealized_ic </filename>   
</para><para>
   b) Realistic 3-D data (initial condition) can be generated through 
 <filename>preprocessing/regrid_3d</filename> when the source data is on lon/lat grid.
</para><para>
   c) Idealized 2-D forcing data can be generated through 
 preprocessing/mom4_prep/idealized_bc. These idealized forcing data will be placed in the files 
 <filename>temp_sfc_restore.nc, salt_sfc_restore.nc, tau.nc and water_flux.nc</filename>.
</para><para>
   d) Realistic 2-D forcing data can be generated through 
 preprocessing/regrid_2d when the input data is on lon/lat grid.
</para><para>
   e) When the input dat is on tripolar grid, preprocessing/regrid can 
 be used to regrid 2-D and 3-D forcing data. Keep in mind that preprocessing/regrid 
 is not fully tested hence may fail on some cases. So try to find input 
 forcing data on regular lon/lat grid. If you have to use preprocessing/regrid and 
 encouter some problems, please send an email to the mom4 email list about your 
 issues and the issues will be addressed as soon as possible.
</para><para>
   f) If runoff need to be regridded onto your own grid, <filename>preprocessing/runoff_regrid
 </filename> should be used. runoff_regrid can only accept input data sets on
regular  lon/lat grid. This tool moves the river runoff from a spherical grid  onto 
your model grid, whether spherical or tripolar. It places the river runoff onto the sea
point nearest to the land near where the original data was located. Care should be taken to
be sure you are satisfied with the results of these steps.

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
 Can I use the datasets of mom4 test as input for the regrid 
 procedure, or do I need to use original lat-lon datasets?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
   You can use the datasets of mom4 test as input for regridding, but it
 is not recommended when the grid of the mom4 test is tripolar grid. When the input data is 
 on tripolar grid, you have to use preprocessing/regrid. As mentioned in the previous 
 question, you may encounter some problems when you use this tool. If the original
 lat-lon datasets are available, those datasets are recommended to use.

 <question>
  <para>
 When do I need to generate an exchange grid?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
You need to generate exchage grid when your model is driven by the
<filename>coupler_main</filename>
in the directory /coupler.  You do not need to generate an 
exchange grid if you are driving the ocean with <filename>ocean_solo.F90</filename>  in the 
directory mom4/drivers.
</para><para>
    You can check path_names in the input directory to find out if your 
 test is coupled model or solo model. If coupler/coupler_main.f90 is included in the 
 path_names, your test is a coupled model, otherwise it is a solo model.

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
 How do I generate the exchange grid?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
     You can use <filename>preprocessing/generate_grid/make_xgrids</filename> to generate 
 exchange grid. The usage of make_xgrids is: </para><para>
<command>
         make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a atmos_grid.nc -l land_grid.nc. 
</command></para><para>
  Normally <filename>atmos_grid.nc and land_grid.nc</filename> are chosen to be the same. 
 In this case, the usage will be:</para><para>
 <command>        make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a atmos_grid.nc</command>.
</para><para>
     Assume you already generated the grid for ocean model and we call 
 it <filename>ocean_grid.nc</filename>.
     If you decide you want to pick atmosphere grid the same as ocean 
 grid, you can generate the exchange grid by:
<command> make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a  ocean_grid.nc</command>
</para><para>
If you want to pick different resolution of atmosphere grid, you can use 
 ocean_grid_generator to generate another grid file and passed the grid file to make_xgrids through 
option  <command> -a  </command>.

 <question>
  <para>
  We are trying to set up a regional model for Indian ocean using mom4 in Origin 3000.
On integration model blows with CFL violation and gives an error message in fm.out file

=>Error: Land cell at (i,j,k) = ( 1, 1, 1), (lon,lat,dpt) =
( 30.25, -29.75, 5.m) has tracer(n= 1) = NaN
  What may be the reason?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
This message is often the result of the model bombing because of a large time step. Here is what
typically happens.
</para>
 <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
 The model produces infinity for some reason, such as a time step instability. The computer
interprets infinity as NaN.
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
 Some computers are happy to"compute" with NaNs, and so the model will continue running. NaNs
can easily move to land points, since 0.0*NaN is NaN.
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
 When mom4 reaches one of the "diag_freq" time steps determining when to write output to stdout,
it will write NaNs. One of these diagnostic checks examines whether there are nonzero values of
tracer and velocity over land. Since NaN is nonzero, the model brings itself down and produces
the message you quoted.
 </listitem>      
 </orderedlist>
<para>
If the above is happening, then here is what I suggest:
</para><para>
1. Examine the initialization portion of the stdout file fms.out to see if mom4 has found any a
priori problems with your time steps. Are you on the edge of stability, or safely within the linear
constraints for the barotropic, baroclinie, and advection time steps? mom4 performs rudimentary
time step analyses that are often sufficient to find time step problems. However, it certainly
cannot find all problems before running the model.
</para><para>
2. set diag_freq=1 for all places that you can do so, such as the following places:
</para><para>
	&lt;namelist name="ocean_model_nml"&gt; energy_diag_freq=1
</para><para>
These diagnostics may help determine where the NaNs start. The diagnostics may also help to determine
if there is simply a time step instability (resolved by reducing time steps) or something wrong with
your land/sea mask

 <question>
  <para>
I try to perform a spin-up run from rest with temperature and salinity
initial condition from Levitus, but I often have systematic violations
of CFL condition associated with the vertical velocity. Any suggestion?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
Model spin-up is, unfortunately, an art rather than a science. Here are some suggestions:
</para>
 <orderedlist>
 <listitem>
Are you satisfying the time step limits printed in the fms.out file
from mom4 computed during initialization? There are a number of places where mom4 prints this
information depending on the physical process being considered. It may be that you simply have
too large time step. Please read the fms.out file fully to see if
there is something happening along these lines.
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
If you think your time steps are fine, then try running for some
days/months with
zero surface forcing. The initial conditions from Levitus will create
waves that allow the model velocity field to spin up and remove some of the
initialization shock. What often happens when starting from rest and using full
boundary forcing is strong initialization shock that creates fast processes (e.g.,
strong convection, strong waves) that can go unstable whereas normally the model would be
stable. Assuming the model stays stable with no surface forcing, add surface
forcing after a few months. You may wish to add surface forcing piecemeal (e.g.,
first add surface buoyancy forcing for a few days/weeks and then add winds).
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
If the model bombs with zero surface forcing, then you may have some
problems with the Levitus values interpolated to your grid. A way to check
whether this is a problem is to start with zonally averaged Levitus initial
conditions (you can generate these from Ferret). These are smoother and tend to
initiate more mild waves upon startup than with the normal Levitus initial
conditions. If you find this does the trick, then return to the full Levitus initial
conditions and try to move through the initialization shock by taking small time
steps for some period of weeks to months.
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
If the model continues to bomb, then you will need to carefully
investigate the integrity of the surface forcing fields. Have they been properly
interpolated to your model grid? Are there any spurious values that
are well outside the expected physical range? Are the fluxes in the proper units?
 </listitem>
      <listitem>
Finally, there may be some problems initializing the model with a
particular
piece of physics/numerics. Try simplifying the physics from what
likely is a realistic suite to something more like in mom4_test1.
We often see problems with KPP during initialization, so this is a
good candidate to remove first. After some months of running without your
desired physics, then return to the physics you wish.

If there continues to be problems when using the desired physics, then
you may be onto a bug, in which case you will need to diagnose the problem
carefully and understand what is going wrong algorithmically. If you do so, and it
is indeed a bug, then you are beginning to understand what it is to be a mom developer :-)

 What is the use of data_table?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>

During the course of model integration user may want to replace a model field with
values from a data file or even with a const. Data_table lists all fields you
want to override and the source of data used for override. Data_table is also a
convenient way to initialize model. More details are available in shared/data_override.

<qandaentry>
 <question>
  <para>
    What is the significance of the time at the top of the
    <filename>diag_table</filename>? How does this time interact with
   the time used in the model?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
    Let's call the time at the top of <filename>diag_table</filename> T1 and
    the model's initial time T2. The time at the top of the
    <filename>diag_table</filename> (T1) is used as starting time of time axis
    in all output files that have time axis. When you open any output file and
    look for variable Time, you will see:
    <programlisting>
      Time:units = "hours since T1"
    </programlisting>
    (assuming unit is hours).
  </para>
  <para>
    T2 is the initial time of the model, all fields cannot be written
    to output files sooner than T2. Since time can not be negative you should
    have T2 >= T1. In practice, to keep values in time axis from being
    exceedingly large, you'd better have T2=T1.

It is possible that in the diag_table you have initial time = Dec. 31 19xx and the saving

 <question>
  <para>
    How do I set the length of run?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
    In the runscript you see:
    <programlisting>
      set days = 1
      set months = 0
    </programlisting>
    You can change days and months to any number you want. However, note that
    the tests are provided for checking ports of the code to different
    machines, and overall numerical integrity of the code. The tests are not
    guaranteed to run for an indefinite period of time (i.e., they are not ``
    tuned models''). A test case therefore may bomb if changing the runlength
    to something longer.

    What is STATIC option, how do I use this option?
  </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
    Based on our experience with SGI Origins at GFDL, The compiler is
    performing an excessive number of array copies if all the arrays are
    dynamically allocated. The solution is to allocate arrays at compile time.
  </para>
  <para>
    Requirements of static option: each processor should have the same number
    of grid points as all other processor. For example, if your global grid is
    100x100 you can not have 13 processors but you can have 2, 4, 8, 10 ...
    processors.

 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
    In the runscript look for &amp;ocean_solo_nml (or
    <literal>&amp;ocean_coupler_nml</literal> if you run coupled model). You will
    see:
    <programlisting>
      dt_ocean = 3600
    </programlisting>
    This is time step of ocean model measured in seconds. Note that a longer
    time step may violate CFL conditions and the model may bomb.
  </para>
  <para>
    "dt_ocean" corresponds to the ocean tracer time step. The other model time
    steps are set relative to one another via the correspondence
    <programlisting>
       dt_ocean = dtts
                = baroclinic_split * dtuv
                = surface_height_split * dteta

    </programlisting>
    with
    <programlisting>
       dtts  = tracer time step
       dtuv  = baroclinic momentum time step
       dteta = "big leap-frog" time step (the time which updates the surface height)

    Output files are compressed in tar format. First, you need to uncompress
    the output files. The command for extracting a tar file is:
    <programlisting>
      tar -xvf filename.tar
    </programlisting>

    Basically, you need to use restart data instead of initial condition data.
    If you are using the runscripts provided by the
    <command>mom4p0</command> release. Do the following:
    <programlisting>
      Remove the following section from the runscript:

         tar -xvf ocean_tracers_ic.tar
         rm -f ocean_tracers_ic.tar

      and add the following in the same place:

         cp restart_file.nc.tar . (including the path)
         tar -xvf restart_file.nc.tar
         rm -f restart_file.nc.tar

    In both cases users can rely on checksums that are printed at the end of

 What does mppnccombine do? How can I use it
 </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
When running the model on many processors each processor will have a separate output
file (like file.nc.0000, file.nc.0001, ...). mppnccombine will put all these separate
pieces together so that we have a file corresponding to the whole grid.
 </para>
For example, if you run the model on 4 PEs, you will have 4 separate files before combining:
    file.nc.0000 file.nc.0001 file.nc.0002 file.nc.0003
 <para>
Here is the combining command: 
   $MPPNCCOMBINE file.nc
where file.nc is the unified output file, the input is not specified in the 
command line because it is assumed to be identical to the output plus 0000, 
0001, .... By the way running the combining command without any argument will give
help on how to use this command

 <question>
  <para>
 How serious should I take the warning:"WARNING from ocean_freesurf_mod:
eta_t( 26 , 86 )= -1. has been truncated to 1."? does it affect the model
outcome?
 </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
The warning takes place only when truncate_eta=.true. in ocean_freesurf_nml.
This is intended for spinups where the surface height may become extremely large and result in
negative thickness for the top model grid cell. Truncating eta to a small value will NOT conserve
ocean properties. Hence, this option is not recommended for experiments where you are
interested in the results.

In <filename>ocean_core/ocean_sbc.F90</filename>, search for "lprec". You will see that lprec is
part of Ice_ocean_boundary derived type. The assumed units of lprec
are mass units, so there is a division in the code by rho0 to bring it
to m/s. Here are the comments from ocean_sbc.F90

 The model seems to have ended naturally without errors, however model results (history files)

 </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
It is possible that the output frequency (defined in diag_table) is larger than the
model's run length. If output frequency is a month and the model has run only 10 days there
will be zeroes in model output. You need to change either output frequency or run length.

 How serious should I take this  warning in fms.out:
  WARNING from PE 1: ==>Warning: nxland > 0, but use_xlandmix=.false. Remove xland table entries to reduce
memory
 </para>
 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>
The namelist "use_xlandmix" refers to the algorithm "mom4/ocean_param/sources/xlandmix/ocean_xlandmix.f90"
which handles isolated basins such as the Mediterranean, Red Sea, etc. whose relatively narrow passages
are not resolved by the model resolution. In these cases, an ASCII formatted table containing mixing rates
and a depth range between selected points in grid ccordinates can be supplied to achieve the desired
exchange of tracers. You can refer to the html file in the above directory for more information. If you
are not interested in achieving this effect or your model does not contain isolated basins, then you can
safely remove the table from your runscript. Otherwise, you should consider examining the table entries
and enabling this option.

When you generate topography, there is an option
</para> <para>
        fill_first_row
</para>
<para>
My guess is that you have this set .true. in your preprocessing topography generation. In this case,
the zeros that you are reading at j=1 mean this is land.
The reason that we have this option is due to technical details related to coupling to our ice model.
If you are not coupling to the GFDL sea ice model, then fill_first_row=.false. is fine.

 <answer>
  <para>
We always have frazil enabled (see mom4/ocean_core/ocean_tracer.F90) in order to allow the diagnostic
tracer type "T_diag" to be nontrivial, even with idealized simulations where frazil is not used. It is
a bit unclean, but there are trivial computations added which should be of minimal consequence to the
cpu cost.

 Mom4 offers Bryan-Lewis vertical mixing which may vary from equator to the poles. However,
the coefficients afkph_00 and afkph_90 ... defined in ocean_vert_mix.f90 are the same at the
equator and the poles. Is this an error?

 </question>
 <answer>
  <para>

The mom4 default has no latitudinal dependence, since that is the traditional implementation of the
scheme according to Bryan and Lewis (1979).
We have found some utility in our coupled modelling with increased vertical mixing in the higher
latitudes, especially the NAtl. Hence the new flexibility added to mom4.

This is probably because memuse.c is compiled with 32 bit option while other files are
