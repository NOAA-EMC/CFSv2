         26 |!  Opens, reads, and interpolates radiation forcing.
         27 |!
         28 |!    TIME1 = most recent past data\\

         31 |!
         32 |! !REVISION HISTORY:
         33 |!  28 Oct 1999: Brian Cosgrove; Initial code, retrad.f
         34 |!  25 Jun 2001: Urszula Jambor; Renamed & modified for AGRMET data
         35 |!               use in GLDAS.
         36 |!  21 Nov 2001: Urszula Jambor; Added iostat check in open & read stmts;
         37 |!               renamed to distinguish SW from LW routines.
         38 |!  27 Feb 2002: Urszula Jambor; Added call to fill_land to compensate
         39 |!               deficiencies in interpolation to coarse 2x2.5 grid.
         40 |!  16 Oct 2002: Urszula Jambor; Corrected array ranges used in 2x2.5 case.
         41 |!               Previously, array mismatch occurred.
         42 |!  11 Dec 2002: Urszula Jambor; Added domain 4 and 5 in attached routine
