Library versions and variables are defined in setlibs.rc.
Can use load_libs.rc in place of setlibs.rc when library modules are implemented.


To build codes one at a time:
  In sh-like shell:
     source setlibs.rc
  This adds the library variables to the current shell environment.
  Then proceed to each directory:
     make clobber
     make
     make clean
OR:
  build.sh <some_code.fd ...>
will do all of the above.

To build all codes:
  build.sh


To install builds (creating exec dir if necessary):
  sh install.sh <some_code.fd ...>
or 
  sh install.sh
to install all.

This assumes the exec dir belongs one directory back from this directory (and two 
directories back from each code directory).  If you don't trust install scripts
and targets, don't use 'em.


To clean directories
  sh clean.sh <some_code.fd ...>
or 
  sh clean.sh
to clean all.


Examples:
  build.sh
  install.sh
  clean.sh
-or-
  build.sh bufr_dupsat.fd  bufr_dupsst.fd
  install.sh bufr_dupsat.fd  bufr_dupsst.fd
  clean.sh bufr_dupsat.fd  bufr_dupsst.fd
