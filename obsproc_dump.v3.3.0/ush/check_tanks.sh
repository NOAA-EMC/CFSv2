#
# This script identifies dump mnemonics which are not linked to any data
#  presence in the BUFR database tanks over the past 10 days.  In this case,
#  it returns a status code of 1.  It can be called by the dump scripts,
#  alerting them to not attempt to dump a mnemonic whose tank(s) are either 1)
#  no longer in the database, or 2) not yet available in the database.  This
#  prevents empty dump files from being generated day after day {in case 1,
#  until the dump script is modified to remove the attempt to dump the
#  mnemonic in question, in case 2, until the tank(s) associated with the
#  mnemonic in question are populated with data}, and it prevents dump alerts
#  from being generated for the mnemonic in question.
#
#  If at least one database tank associated with the mnemonic is present on at
#  least one day in the last ten (even if it is zero bytes), this script
#  returns with status code zero.  Otherwise, it returns with status code 1.
#  Note that "group" mnemonics, i.e., those associated with more than one
#  database tank file, can also be checked here.  In this case, only one of
#  the database tank files needs to present over one of the past ten days in
#  order to genrrate a status code of zero.
#
#
# Usage:
#      sh check_tanks.sh <dump mnemonic>
#
# Script variables imported:
#  DATA - path to working directory coming into this script
#         (NO DEFAULT - MUST BE PASSED INTO THIS SCRIPT)
#         (working direct. in this script is $DATA/check_tanks_<dump mnemonic>)
#  TANK - path to database tanks up to the YYYYMMDD
#         (default is /dcom/us007003)
#  LIST - complete path to bufr_dumplist fixed file
#         (default is $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist/bufr_dumplist)
#         (If $LIST not imported, then $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist MUST
#          BE PASSED INTO THIS SCRIPT)
#  cycle - e.g., t12z
#         (default is t00z)
#
#   Modules and files referenced:
#     executables:  $NDATE (presumably from default or specified version of
#                           module prod_util)
#
# Remarks:
#   Only one dump mnemonic at a time can be processed by this script.
