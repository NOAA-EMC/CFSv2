! Program will run with nesdis/ims cover data (nh only), afwa depth data
! (nh and sh), and autosnow cover data (sh only).  A depth and
! cover analysis is produced.
!
! Note: When the program was originally created, the ims cover data
! was produced by nesdis.  It is now produced by the national ice
! center.  However, variable names and print statements still use
! the nesdis tag.  If you see a reference to nesdis in the code or
! namelist, it refers to the ims product.
!
! In the NH: 
!  (1) afwa data may be used by itself
!  (2) nesdis/ims data may be used by itself
!  (3) both data sets may used.
!
! When (1) is chosen, cover and depth are set from afwa.
! When (2) is chosen, the depth is set to "min_snow_depth" where
! nesdis/ims indicates snow cover.  "min_snow_depth" is set
! below via namelist.
! When (3) is chosen, the final snow depth will
! be a blend of the two data sources.  If nesdis/ims indicates snow
! cover, the final depth will be set to the afwa value or 
! "min_snow_depth", whichever is greater.  If nesdis/ims indicates no
! snow cover, then the final depth is set to zero regardless
! of the afwa value. 
!
! In the SH: 
!  (1) afwa data may be used by itself
!  (2) autosnow data may be used by itself
!  (3) both data sets may used.
!
! When (1) is chosen, cover and depth are set from afwa.
! When (2) is chosen, the depth is set to "min_snow_depth" where
! autosnow indicates snow cover.  
! When (3) is chosen, the final snow depth will
! be a blend of the two data sources.  If autosnow indicates snow
! cover, the final depth will be set to the afwa value or 
! "min_snow_depth", whichever is greater.  If autosnow indicates no snow
! cover, then the final depth is set to zero regardless
! of the afwa value. 
!
! Namelist settings are thus:
!
! autosnow_file: path and name of autosnow snow cover data (grib 2 format).
! To not use, set to zero length string.
!
! nesdis_snow_file: path and name of nesdis/ims snow cover grib data.
! Can use either the 23 (16th mesh) or 4 km (96th mesh) file.  Can be 
! grib 1 or grib 2 versions. To not use, set to zero length string.
!
! nesdis_lsmask_file: path and name of nesdis/ims 23 km (16th mesh) land mask.
! This file is only needed for the 23 km data because it is not
! gribbed with a bitmap section.  When using the 4km nesdis/ims data,
! set the string length to zero. The 23km mask is "/nwprod/fix/nam_imsmask".
! To not use, set to zero length string.
!
! afwa_snow_global_file: name and path of global afwa snow depth data (grib 1).
! To not use, set to zero length string.
!
! afwa_snow_nh(sh)_file: name and path of nh(sh) afwa snow depth data.
! May choose 46 km (8th mesh) binary file or 23 km (16th mesh) grib 1 file.
! To not use, set to zero length string.
!
! afwa_lsmask_nh(sh)_file: name and path of nh(sh) afwa land/sea mask.
! Needed when using 46 km binary files, which do not have a bitmap.
! To not use, set to zero length string.
!
! climo_qc_file: path and name of climatological snow cover file used to 
! quality control the nesdis/ims and nh afwa data.  optional.  if
! not chosen (set to zero length string), a more rudimentary qc is done.
! file is grib 1 format.
!
! model_lat(lon)_file: name and path of model lat/lon data (grib 1)
!
! model_lsmask_file: name and path of model land/sea mask (grib 1)
!
! gfs_lpl_file: gfs reduced grid definition (text file)
! To run on full gfs grid, don't select (set to zero length string).
!
! model_snow_file: User selected file name for output snow depth and 
! coverage on model grid (grib 1).
!
! &output_grib_time entries:  The various input sources are valid at 
! different times.  This namelist allows you to set the grib header date/time
! in the "model_snow_file" to anything you wish.
!
! lat_threshold: After interpolation of the nesdis/ims and afwa data to
! the model grid, some model points may still be undefined (no nesdis/ims
! or afwa data nearby).  In this case, set all undefined points poleward
! of the threshold to a snow cover of 100% if the nesdis/ims indicates
! sea ice nearby.  Otherwise, set snow coverage and depth to zero. 
! 
! snow_cvr_threshold: If nesdis/ims or autosnow indicates a coverage
! above this threshold, the model point is considered snow covered
! and given a non-zero depth of "min_snow_depth" or the afwa depth,
! whichever is greater.  Otherwise, the snow depth is zero.
!
! min_snow_depth: The minimum snow depth (in meters) of a model point
! if nesdis/ims or autosnow indicate snow cover above "snow_cvr_threshold".
