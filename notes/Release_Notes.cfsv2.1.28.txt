RUN TIME DIFFERENCES

Note: all resources are the same for the new version. The time differences are shown below.
The ratio of wall/cpu time is given to in part account for the difference running prod vs dev.
Clearly the ocnanal will take longer; how much longer will need to be seen. This is due to
the additional data being delivered to the ocean process, some significant amount being 
dupilcates, at least for the time being.
