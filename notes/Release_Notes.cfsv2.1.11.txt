CFS AWIPS to SPA
Boi Vuong


1. Description
         The script (excfs_grib_awips.sh.ecf) uses to generate AWIPS grid for CFS with fields:
         Total Precipitation Rate (PRATE), Max Temperature at 2m above ground and MIN
         Temperature at 2m above ground run at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles for forecast
         hours from 06 up to variable length of forecast hours at every 6-hour.

2. Scripts
This script (excfs_grib_awips.sh.ecf) is in EMC SVN repository:
https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nceplibs/util/cfs/tags/cfs_v2.1.11_scripts/

3. Data cards
The data cards are in EMC SVN repository:
https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nceplibs/util/cfs/tags/cfs_v2.1.11_parms/

4. Jobs
The JCFS_AWIPS is a new job in ECF system to process CFS products for AWIPS.
The (JCFS_AWIPS) job is EMC SVN repository:
https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nceplibs/util/cfs/tags/cfs_v2.1.11_jobs/

5. Implementation Instructions
- copy script (excfs_grib_awips.sh.ecf) /nwprod/cfs.v2.1.11/scripts
- copy job (JCFS_AWIPS) to /nwprod/cfs.v2.1.11/jobs
- copy all data cards to /nwprod/cfs.v2.1.117/parm

6. SOURCE CODE
The program (tocgrib2_cfs.f) uses to add WMO headers to GRIB message for AWIPS
products.  The source code (tocgrib2_cfs and makefile) are in EMC SVN repository:
https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nceplibs/util/tocgrib2_cfs/tags/tocgrib2_cfs_v1.0.0/



- copy source code (tocgrib2_cfs.f and makefile) to /nwprod/util/sorc/tocgrib2_cfs.fd
- run make to compile tocgrib2_cfs.f
- copy executable tocgrib2_cfs to /nwprod/util/exec

7. Test Plan
         The test plan (JCFS_AWIPS.test) file is in EMC SVN repository:
         https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nceplibs/util/cfs/tags/cfs_v2.1.11_test_plan/
